            Enable USB HID keyboard support for game input.
            This requires USB host capabilities and is automatically
            enabled for ESP32-P4 which has built-in USB host support.
            
            This feature allows connecting USB keyboards directly to
            the ESP32 board for game control input.

    config FRUITLAND_ACCELEROMETER_INPUT

        default y if SDL_BSP_ESP_BOX_3
        default n
        help
            Enable accelerometer-based motion control for game input.
            This uses the onboard ICM42670 6-axis accelerometer to detect
            device tilt and translate it to directional movement commands.
            
            Automatically enabled for ESP32-S3-BOX-3 which has the
            ICM42670 accelerometer sensor built-in.
            
            This feature allows playing the game by tilting the device
            in the desired movement direction.
